🌊 CyberCup – AI-Powered Urban Flood Monitoring System

CyberCup is an intelligent flood monitoring and prediction system that integrates IoT-based sensors, machine learning, and an interactive web dashboard to identify waterlogging risks and assist authorities with timely decision-making.

🚀 Features

🌧️ IoT-Based Data Collection

Rainfall intensity and drainage water levels are collected from on-field ESP32-based IoT devices.

Sensors include ultrasonic water-level sensors and rain gauges.

🧠 Flood Prediction using Machine Learning

A trained LightGBM model predicts water level severity using real sensor data.

🗺️ Interactive Web Dashboard

Live visualization of flood-prone locations on a map.

Status indicators: Safe, Warning, Danger.

🚦 Automated Control Strategies

System recommends mitigation actions (pump activation, diversion channels, traffic control) based on predicted flood levels.

🌐 Unified Backend + Frontend Deployment

Flask backend serves APIs as well as the static frontend (HTML, CSS, JS).

⚙️ Tech Stack

Backend: Flask (Python)

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Machine Learning: LightGBM

IoT Hardware: ESP32, Ultrasonic Sensor, Rain Gauge

Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy

Deployment: Render

🔌 IoT Integration

Each monitoring unit consists of:

Ultrasonic sensor → Measures drainage water level (cm)

Rain gauge → Calculates rainfall intensity (mm/hr)

ESP32 → Sends periodic sensor readings

Sample data format generated by the IoT device:

timestamp,unit_id,rainfall_mm_hr,drainage_level_cm,flow_rate_lps


This data is used by the backend for:

ML prediction

Dashboard visualization

Control strategy generation

🧠 Machine Learning Logic

The ML model predicts water level severity (meters) using:

Rainfall intensity (mm/hr)

Drainage water level (cm)

Flow rate (lps)

Risk Classification

≤ 0.9 m → Safe

0.9 – 1.8 m → Warning

> 1.8 m → Danger
